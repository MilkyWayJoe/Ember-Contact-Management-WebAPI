#Ember Contact Management#

##Why?##

This is a sample project. Its intent is to explore some common scenarios of a web application with a .NET Web API backend. This is based on [Ember-Contact-Management-ConceptUI](https://github.com/MilkyWayJoe/Ember-Contact-Management-ConceptUI).

Please note that this the very first version and it's still work in progress.
